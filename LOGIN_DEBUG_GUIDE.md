# üîê LOGIN ISSUE - "Invalid Mobile Number or Password"

## ‚úÖ CURRENT PROGRESS
- Registration working ‚úÖ
- OTP emails working ‚úÖ 
- OTP verification working ‚úÖ
- User approved in Google Sheet ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Login failing with "Invalid mobile number or password" ‚ùå

## üîç DIAGNOSIS

From your console logs, I can see:
- CORS POST fails (expected)
- GET fallback is working ‚úÖ
- But returning: `{success: false, message: 'Invalid mobile number or password'}`

This means the Google Apps Script is running but not finding a match for your credentials.

## üõ†Ô∏è DEBUGGING STEPS

### Step 1: Update Google Apps Script with Enhanced Login Debugging

1. **Replace your Code.gs** with the updated `google-apps-script-auth.js`
2. **Save and Deploy new version**
3. The updated script has detailed logging for login attempts

### Step 2: Run Debug Function

Add this function to your Google Apps Script and run it:

```javascript
function debugUserLogin() {
  // This function is already in the updated script
  // Just run it to see your sheet data
}
```

**To run:**
1. Select `debugUserLogin` from function dropdown
2. Click "Run"
3. Check "Executions" tab for console logs
4. Look for your user data details

### Step 3: Check Your Google Sheet Data

**Verify in your Google Sheet:**
1. Open: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g5MLKqJUzMqFu9sua4AP9SsPK-FAMZ-wvICAPpjLM9s/
2. Check the user row for mobile: `9646122222`
3. **Verify these columns exactly**:
   - Column B (Mobile): Should be `9646122222`
   - Column G (Status): Should be `Approved` (exact case)
   - Column H (Password): Should be `123456`
   - Column I (OTPStatus): Should be `Verified` (exact case)

### Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Mobile stored as `'9646122222` (with quote) | Remove quotes in sheet |
| Status is `approved` instead of `Approved` | Fix capitalization |
| OTPStatus is `verified` instead of `Verified` | Fix capitalization |
| Password has extra spaces | Remove spaces in sheet |
| Data in wrong columns | Check column order |

## üéØ MOST LIKELY CAUSES

### 1. Case Sensitivity Issues
- Status must be exactly `Approved` (capital A)
- OTPStatus must be exactly `Verified` (capital V)

### 2. Data Type Mismatch
- Mobile number stored as text vs number
- Extra spaces in password field

### 3. Wrong Column Mapping
The script expects this order:
- Column A: Name
- Column B: Mobile
- Column C: Email  
- Column D: Company
- Column E: Registration Date
- Column F: Last Login
- Column G: Status
- Column H: Password
- Column I: OTP Status

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE STEPS

1. **Update Google Apps Script** with enhanced debugging
2. **Deploy new version**
3. **Try login again** - now with detailed logs
4. **Check "Executions" tab** in Google Apps Script for detailed debugging info
5. **Run `debugUserLogin()` function** to see exact sheet data
6. **Fix any data mismatches** in your Google Sheet

## üìã WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN LOGS

After trying login, check for these messages in execution logs:

- ‚úÖ `"Mobile number match found!"` = Mobile is correct
- ‚úÖ `"Password match found!"` = Password is correct  
- ‚ùå `"OTP not verified"` = Fix OTPStatus to "Verified"
- ‚ùå `"Account not approved"` = Fix Status to "Approved"
- ‚ùå `"Mobile mismatch"` = Check mobile number format
- ‚ùå `"Password mismatch"` = Check password exactly

The enhanced logging will show you exactly where the login is failing!

## üéØ SUCCESS INDICATOR

When working, you should see in logs:
```
‚úÖ Login successful for user: [Your Name]
```

**Next Step**: Update your Google Apps Script and check the execution logs to see exactly what data doesn't match.
