# üîß REGISTRATION DATA NOT REACHING GOOGLE SHEET - DIAGNOSIS & SOLUTION

## üö® The Problem
Your registration data is not reaching the Google Sheet because:

1. **CORS (Cross-Origin) Policy Blocks**: Browsers block requests to Google Apps Script when using `mode: 'no-cors'`
2. **No-CORS Requests Don't Send Data**: The `mode: 'no-cors'` prevents POST data from being transmitted properly
3. **Fallback Methods Are Fake**: The current fallback just returns success without actually sending data

## ‚úÖ The Solution
Use **form submission** method which bypasses CORS restrictions and actually sends data to Google Apps Script.

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE STEPS TO FIX

### Step 1: Test Current Setup
1. Open your app in browser
2. Try registering with test data
3. Check if new tab opens when you register
4. **If no new tab opens**, the JavaScript needs to be updated

### Step 2: Verify Form Submission Method is Working

The updated `login.html` now uses this method:
- Creates an invisible HTML form
- Adds all registration data as hidden form fields
- Submits the form to your Google Apps Script URL
- **Opens in new tab so you can see if it reaches Google Apps Script**

### Step 3: Test Registration Process

1. **Register with Real Data**:
   - Use a real email you can check
   - Fill complete registration form
   - Click "Register & Verify Email"

2. **Check New Tab**:
   - A new tab should open showing Google Apps Script response
   - If you see "Registration successful" or similar message = DATA REACHED GOOGLE SHEET ‚úÖ
   - If you see error or blank page = Problem with Google Apps Script ‚ùå

3. **Check Google Sheet**:
   - Open: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g5MLKqJUzMqFu9sua4AP9SsPK-FAMZ-wvICAPpjLM9s/
   - Look for new row with your registration data
   - If data appears = WORKING! ‚úÖ
   - If no data = Google Apps Script needs fixing ‚ùå

### Step 4: If Data Still Not Reaching Google Sheet

**Problem is in Google Apps Script. Follow these steps:**

1. **Go to Google Apps Script**: https://script.google.com/
2. **Open your project** (the one with your web app URL)
3. **Replace Code.gs** with the corrected `google-apps-script-auth.js` from your workspace
4. **Save** the script
5. **Deploy** ‚Üí "Manage Deployments" ‚Üí Click Edit icon ‚Üí "New Version" ‚Üí Deploy

### Step 5: Test Email OTP

After data reaches Google Sheet:
1. Check your email for OTP (including spam folder)
2. If no email received, the Gmail API might not be enabled
3. In Google Apps Script: Libraries ‚Üí Add "Gmail API" ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Re-deploy

## üîç DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

- [ ] New tab opens when registering (form submission working)
- [ ] Google Apps Script response shows success in new tab
- [ ] Registration data appears in Google Sheet
- [ ] Real OTP email received (not 123456)
- [ ] Login only works after admin approval

## üÜò If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Google Apps Script Logs**: 
   - Script Editor ‚Üí "Executions" tab
   - Look for errors when registration is submitted

2. **Verify Web App Deployment**:
   - Make sure it's deployed as "Anyone can access"
   - Use the correct, latest web app URL

3. **Test Google Sheet Manually**:
   - Try adding data directly to see if sheet is accessible

The form submission method in the updated `login.html` should solve the data transmission issue!
